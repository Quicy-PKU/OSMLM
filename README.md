# Optimal Subsampling for Multinomial Logistic Models with Big Data

This repository is the implementation of "Optimal Subsampling for Multinomial Logistic Models with Big Data". 
This folder includes the main experiments for calculating MSE and computing time in this work. 
Feel free to ask if any questions.
Simulation1.R contains the code to reproduce Figure 1.
Simulation2.R contains the code to reproduce Tables S1 and S2 in the supplementary material
Realdata.R contains the code we use in the realdata analysis. 
Please use the cleaned data in realdata file.
Realdata_preprocess.py contains the code we use to obtain the cleaned real data.
